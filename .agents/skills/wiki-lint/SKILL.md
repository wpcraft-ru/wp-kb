# Wiki Lint

Run a health audit over wiki pages.

## Scope

Scan under `src/content/docs/`, excluding:
- `src/content/docs/index.md`
- `src/content/docs/log.md`

## Checks

Priority order:
1. Errors:
- Broken relative links.
- Missing required frontmatter fields (`title`, `description`).

2. Warnings:
- Orphan pages (no inbound links).
- Contradictory statements between pages.
- Clearly stale claims.

3. Info:
- Missing cross-references between related pages.
- Concepts repeatedly mentioned but lacking a dedicated page.

## Process

1. Build page/link inventory.
2. Produce severity-grouped report with concrete file paths.
3. Suggest precise fixes for each issue.
4. Append `src/content/docs/log.md`:
   - `## [YYYY-MM-DD] lint | <N issues found>`

## Quality Bar

- Findings first, summary second.
- Prefer actionable fixes over generic advice.

## Done Criteria

- Severity-ordered findings are reported.
- `log.md` has lint entry.
